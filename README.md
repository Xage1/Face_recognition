Facial Recognition Project
This project implements a basic facial recognition system using OpenCV in Python. The system captures face images, trains a model using the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm, and recognizes faces in real-time through a webcam.

Features
•	Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using the Haar Cascade classifier.
•	Image Capture: Captures face images and saves them for training.
•	Model Training: Trains a facial recognition model using the LBPH algorithm.
•	Real-Time Recognition: Recognizes faces in real-time and displays the results.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	OpenCV
•	NumPy
•	PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-project.git
cd facial-recognition-project
2.	Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy pillow
3.	Ensure the Haar Cascade XML file is available. The code will automatically download it if it's missing.
Usage
1. Capture Images
To capture images for training, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
python your_script.py
This script will start capturing images for each label (e.g., Person 1, Person 2). The captured images are saved in the specified directory.
2. Train the Model
After capturing the images, the script will automatically train the recognizer and save the trained model in the training_data.yml file.
3. Real-Time Face Recognition
Once the model is trained, the script will start the real-time face recognition process. It will detect and recognize faces in the webcam feed.
4. Quit the Application
Press q to stop the image capture, training, or recognition process and exit the application.
